  # WARNING: `configVersion` indicates the schema version of the config file.
  # This value tells RapiDAST what schema should be used to read this configuration.
  # Therefore you should only change it if you update the configuration to a newer schema
  # It is intended to keep backward compatibility (newer RapiDAST running an older config)
