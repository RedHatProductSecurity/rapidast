  # WARNING: `configVersion` indicates the schema version of the config file.
  # This value tells RapiDAST what schema should be used to read this configuration.
  # Therefore you should only change it if you update the configuration to a newer schema
  # It is intended to keep backward compatibility (newer RapiDAST running an older config)
  configVersion: 5

# `application` contains data related to the application, not to the scans.
application:
  shortName: "MyApp-1.0"

# `general` is a section that will be applied to all scanners.
general:
  container:
    # This configures what technology is to be used for RapiDAST to run each scanner.
    # Currently supported: `podman`  and `none`
    #   none: Default. RapiDAST runs each scanner in the same host or inside the RapiDAST image container
    #   podman: RapiDAST orchestrates each scanner on its own using podman
    # When undefined, relies on rapidast-defaults.yaml, or `none` if nothing is set
    type: "none"

# `scanners' is a section that configures scanning options
scanners:
  generic_trivy:
    # results:
    #   An absolute path to file or directory where results are stored on the host.
    #   if it is "*stdout" or unspecified, the command's standard output will be selected
    #   When container.type is 'podman', this needs to be used along with the container.volumes configuration below
    #   If the result needs to be sent to DefectDojo, this must be a SARIF format file
    #results: "/path/to/results"

    # Example: scan the alpine image
    inline: "trivy image alpine:latest"

      parameters:
        # Optional: list of expected return codes, anything else will be considered as an error. by default: [0]
