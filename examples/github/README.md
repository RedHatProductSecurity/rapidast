# RapiDAST in GitHub

See the sample [workflow.yml](./workflow.yml) file for details.

## Notes

- The example [workflow.yml](./workflow.yml) file can be included in a github source repository in a path like `.github/workflows/rapidast.yml`
- The "rapidast-config.yml" file is expected to be in the source repository already. See [here](../config) for config templates.
