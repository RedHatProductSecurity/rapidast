# This is a configuration template file to perform scans using ZAP and user-defined container images
#
# Author: Red Hat Product Security
#
# This shows only the most important configuration entries for each scanning option.
# For more configuration options, see "config-template-long.yaml" for ZAP scan and "config-template-generic-scan.yaml" for user-defined scan

config:
  # WARNING: `configVersion` indicates the schema version of the config file.
  # This value tells RapiDAST what schema should be used to read this configuration.
  # Therefore you should only change it if you update the configuration to a newer schema
  # It is intended to keep backward compatibility (newer RapiDAST running an older config)
  configVersion: 5

# `application` contains data related to the application, not to the scans.
application:
  shortName: "MyApp-1.0"
  url: "<Mandatory. root URL of the application>"

# `general` is a section that will be applied to all scanners.

  authentication:
    type: http_basic
    parameters:
      username: "user"
      password: "mypassw0rd"

  container:
    # This configures what technology is to be used for RapiDAST to run each scanner.
    # Currently supported: `podman`, `flatpak` and `none`
    #   podman: RapiDAST runs each scanner using podman
    #   flatpak: RapiDAST runs each scanner using flatpak
    #   none: RapiDAST runs each scanner in the same host or container (where RapiDAST itself is running in a container)
    # When undefined, relies on rapidast-defaults.yaml, or `podman` if nothing is set
    #type: "podman"

# `scanners' is a section that configures scanning options
# See the config-template-long.yaml for more options
